# CodeRoute Guinée — Worklog

---
Task ID: 1
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Implement 3 priority missing features: Real Authentication, Database Connection, Payment Integration

Work Log:
- Analyzed existing codebase: Prisma schema, API routes, auth context, frontend components
- Discovered DB was already initialized with schema and seed data, but passwords were unknown
- Created comprehensive seed script (prisma/seed.ts) with known test accounts and passwords
- Ran seed script successfully — DB now has 6 users, 7 centres, 41 questions, 3 courses, 3 exam sessions, 31 daily stats, 3 fraud alerts
- Created JWT session management library (src/lib/session.ts) using jose for Edge-compatible JWT signing
- Updated login API route to create JWT sessions with httpOnly cookies
- Updated register API route to auto-create sessions on registration
- Created logout API route (src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts)
- Created session verification API route (src/app/api/auth/me/route.ts)
- Created middleware (src/middleware.ts) for route protection with JWT verification
- Updated auth-context.tsx to use server-side sessions with localStorage fallback
- Created Mobile Money payment integration library (src/lib/mobile-money.ts)
  - Supports Orange Money (prefixes 622/621/620), MTN (626/627/628), Celcom (623/624/625)
  - Provider detection from phone number
  - Phone number validation
  - Payment initiation with real API support (when API keys configured) or sandbox mode
  - Payment verification with polling
  - USSD code generation per provider
- Created payment API routes:
  - POST /api/payments — initiate payment
  - POST /api/payments/verify — verify payment status
  - GET /api/payments/status — check booking payment status
- Updated exam-booking.tsx with full Mobile Money integration:
  - Provider auto-detection as user types phone number
  - Visual provider badges (Orange/MTN/Celcom)
  - Phone number validation with error messages
  - Payment flow: create booking → initiate payment → wait for phone confirmation → verify
  - Pending payment screen with USSD code display
  - Confirmed payment with full booking details and QR code
- Added SESSION_SECRET and Mobile Money API keys to .env
- Added db:seed script to package.json
- Build verification: ✅ All routes compile successfully

Stage Summary:
- Real authentication: ✅ JWT sessions with bcrypt password hashing, httpOnly cookies, middleware protection
- Database connection: ✅ Prisma fully connected, seed script with 6 test accounts
- Payment integration: ✅ Mobile Money (Orange/MTN/Celcom) with provider detection, validation, API integration framework

Task: Connect frontend components to real API data instead of mock-data

- Created /api/admin/stats route — returns full dashboard data (KPI, monthly volume, regional stats, fraud alerts, centres, category scores)
- Updated candidate-dashboard.tsx to fetch exam sessions and stats from /api/exams/candidate
  - Loading state while data fetches
  - Empty state when no exams exist
  - Dynamic stats from real DB data
- Updated exam-taking.tsx to load questions from /api/questions?random=true instead of mock-data
  - Fallback to mock-data if API fails
  - Dynamic question count based on practice vs real exam
- Updated courses-page.tsx to load courses from /api/courses with fallback to mock-data
  - Maps API response to Course type
  - Dynamically loaded on component mount
- Updated admin-dashboard.tsx (via sub-agent) to load all data from /api/admin/stats
  - Replaced ~90 lines of hardcoded mock data with API-fetched state
  - Added loading state, error handling, refresh button
  - All charts now use real data from the database
  - Empty state displays for sections with no data
- Build verification: ✅ All 22 routes compile successfully

Stage Summary:
- candidate-dashboard: ✅ Connected to /api/exams/candidate
- exam-taking: ✅ Connected to /api/questions with fallback
- courses-page: ✅ Connected to /api/courses with fallback
- admin-dashboard: ✅ Connected to /api/admin/stats with full data refresh
